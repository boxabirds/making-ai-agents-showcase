- whenever creating a new feature it should structured like this: 
1. in docs/features each feature has its own dir <feature-id>/ in which prd.md contains the problem statements and nontechnical solution elements. 
2. in docs/backlog.md contains an index of each feature id, name, and status (pending, in progress, done, paused) each with a unique id. If there is a request to create a new feature, a  unique id is identified and name/id added to backlog at bottom by default. 
3. each feature has a tech design in @docs/designs/<feature-id>/tech-design.md. Designs must be exhaustive in detail, down to the types, functions, and classes, including appropriate unit and integration test specifications. Tech designs do NOT include implementation but in complex cases do include proposed algorithm pseudocode. All tech design docs include exhaustive use of mermaid digrams: component for static relationships and cardinality, and sequence for golden, alternate and error paths. Tech design docs make extensive use of headings and subheadings for referenceability. 
4. each feature has a plan in @docs/plans/<feature-id>/tasks.md which tracks every task, ordered by priority top to bottom, with columns task id, task name, status (pending, in progress, done). Adding new tasks allocates a new task id, name and id. Task breakdowns of tech designs are fine-grained and sequenced so they can be started and finished sequentially (avoiding starting x tasks at once and having them all in progress). 
5. Task ids are globally unique defined as <feature-id>-<task id>
6. every task has its own file inside plans/<feature-id>/ named <task id>.md (e.g. 1-1.md for feature id 1, task 1). Tasks are planning devices: they do not include design decisions and instead refer to the exhaustive design material in the tech design doc by section. E.g. "implements citation evaluation as per §3.2", and include testing. Tasks start by creating tests that fail, then implementing / debugging until they pass. 
7. every feature is bookended with a BDD test covering different feature variations.
- backlog.md should be ordered by priority / dependency. First items at top
