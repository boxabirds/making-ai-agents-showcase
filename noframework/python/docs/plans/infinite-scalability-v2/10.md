# Task 10: get_definition Tool

## Objective
Implement the `get_definition` tool to find where a symbol is defined.

## Dependencies
- Task 8: get_symbols tool

## Deliverables

`tech_writer/tools/semantic.py` (additions):

```python
def get_definition(
    name: str,
    store: Store = None
) -> dict | None:
    """
    Find where a symbol is defined (across all cached files).

    Args:
        name: Symbol name (function, class, variable)
        store: Cache store

    Returns:
        {"path": str, "line": int, "kind": str, "signature": str | None}
        or None if not found in cached files.
    """
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Searches all cached files for symbol definition
- [ ] Returns first match (by file path order for determinism)
- [ ] Returns None if symbol not found
- [ ] Only searches already-cached files (no new reads)
- [ ] Matches exact name (case-sensitive)

## Test Cases (using axios repo)

```gherkin
Feature: get_definition tool

  Scenario: Find class definition
    Given the axios repository is cloned
    And I have read "lib/core/Axios.js"
    When I call get_definition("Axios")
    Then I should get the definition location
    And the path should be "lib/core/Axios.js"
    And the kind should be "class"

  Scenario: Symbol not in cache
    Given the axios repository is cloned
    And I have read "lib/axios.js"
    When I call get_definition("SomeUnknownThing")
    Then I should get None

  Scenario: Symbol in unread file
    Given the axios repository is cloned
    And I have NOT read "lib/core/Axios.js"
    When I call get_definition("Axios")
    Then I should get None
    # Because we only search cached files
```

## Output Format

```python
{
    "path": "lib/core/Axios.js",
    "line": 15,
    "kind": "class",
    "signature": "class Axios"
}
```

## Implementation Notes

- Query `store.get_all_symbols()` to search across files
- Filter by exact name match
- Include file path in result (from symbol's file_id)
