# Task 1: Citation Extraction

## Design Reference
- [tech-design.md §3.2.1](../../design/citation-eval/tech-design.md#321-stage-1-citation-extraction)
- [tech-design.md §4.1](../../design/citation-eval/tech-design.md#41-term-extraction)

## Objective
Extract all citations and their associated claims from a markdown report using regex.

## Requirements

### R1.1: Citation Pattern Matching
Extract citations matching pattern `[file_path:start_line-end_line]`

### R1.2: Claim Extraction
For each citation, extract the containing sentence as the "claim"

### R1.3: Output Structure
Return `ExtractedCitation` objects per tech-design.md §8.2

## Dependencies
None

## Test Plan

| Test | Input | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| Basic extraction | `"Text [a.py:1-10] more"` | 1 citation, path="a.py", lines 1-10 |
| Multiple citations | `"[a.py:1-2] and [b.py:3-4]"` | 2 citations |
| Nested brackets | `"Array [a[0]] at [c.py:5-6]"` | 1 citation (c.py only) |
| No citations | `"Plain text"` | Empty list |
| Malformed | `"[a.py:10]"` (missing end) | Not matched |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All valid citations extracted from sample reports
- [ ] Claim text correctly identifies containing sentence
- [ ] Position tracking enables downstream context extraction
- [ ] Handles edge cases (nested brackets, special chars in paths)
