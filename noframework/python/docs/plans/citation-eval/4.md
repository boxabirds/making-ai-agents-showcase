# Task 4: Claim Classification

## Design Reference
- [tech-design.md §3.2.3](../../design/citation-eval/tech-design.md#323-stage-3-claim-classification)
- [tech-design.md §4](../../design/citation-eval/tech-design.md#4-extractive-verification-design)

## Objective
Classify claims as extractive or abstractive to route to appropriate verification method.

## Requirements

### R4.1: Extractive Detection
Identify extractive claims using patterns from tech-design.md §13.1:
- Contains code spans (backticks)
- Names specific symbols ("function X", "class Y")
- Describes locations ("defined in", "found at")

### R4.2: Abstractive Detection
Identify abstractive claims:
- Behavioral verbs ("handles", "manages", "provides")
- High-level concepts ("architecture", "design", "pattern")
- Purpose/intent language ("responsible for", "ensures")

### R4.3: Unknown Handling
Claims matching neither pattern → default to extractive (conservative)

### R4.4: Output
Return `ClassificationResult` per tech-design.md §8.4

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Citation extraction (provides claims to classify)

## Test Plan

| Test | Claim | Expected |
|------|-------|----------|
| Code span | "The `validate` function..." | extractive |
| Symbol name | "The User class has..." | extractive |
| Behavioral | "The module handles authentication" | abstractive |
| Purpose | "This ensures data integrity" | abstractive |
| Ambiguous | "The system processes requests" | unknown → extractive |
| Mixed | "The `auth` module handles login" | extractive (code span wins) |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extractive patterns from tech-design.md §13.1 implemented
- [ ] Abstractive patterns from tech-design.md §13.1 implemented
- [ ] Classification confidence reflects pattern match strength
- [ ] No LLM calls (pure heuristics)
