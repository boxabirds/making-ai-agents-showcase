# Task 17 — Coverage Modeling

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Derive expected surface from symbols plus endpoints/routes/config/build targets, not just string matches.
- Include skipped/unparsed files in expected coverage and surface them in gating.
- Replace string-contains coverage heuristic with structured mapping from claims to targets.

## Deliverables
- Coverage builder that enumerates symbols/endpoints/config/build items (and skipped files) as targets.
- Claim-to-target matching logic using citations/symbol metadata rather than substring checks.
- Gating hooks that account for uncovered targets and skipped files.

## Test Plan
- Unit: coverage builder includes endpoints/config/build targets and skipped files.
- Unit: claim-to-target matcher uses citations/symbol IDs; substring-only cases rejected.
- Integration: coverage score reflects missing endpoints/config/build items and skipped files; gating fails appropriately.
