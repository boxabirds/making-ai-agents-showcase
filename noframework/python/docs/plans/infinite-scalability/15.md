# Task 15 — Drafting & Citation Repair

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Repair missing citations by retrieving chunks instead of dropping lines; preserve user-requested sections.
- Enforce drafts only use citations present in the evidence set (no fabricated refs).
- Keep prompt sections intact while patching citations.

## Deliverables
- Draft enforcement/repair module that fills citations using retrieved evidence rather than discarding text.
- Checks ensuring all emitted citations exist in evidence and map to stored chunks.
- Tests demonstrating preserved sections and repaired citations.

## Test Plan
- Unit: lines without citations are patched with retrieved citations, not dropped; fabricated citations rejected.
- Integration: drafted reports retain prompt-required sections after repair; all citations validate against store.
- Property: repair step idempotent and does not introduce duplicates; failures surface actionable errors.
