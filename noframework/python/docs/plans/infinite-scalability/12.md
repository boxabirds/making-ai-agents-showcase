# Task 12 — Ingestion/Graph Completeness

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Provide fallback chunking (or explicit skip records) for unsupported languages so coverage knows about them.
- Extract real symbols and edges (calls/imports/inheritance/member-of/exports) across supported languages; remove Python self-loop placeholders.
- Persist skipped/unparsed files into coverage targets for later remediation.

## Deliverables
- Ingestion updates producing symbols/edges per language; documented skip records for unsupported files.
- Stored metadata marking skipped files and including them in coverage expected surface.
- Tests and fixtures demonstrating multi-language edge extraction and skip handling.

## Test Plan
- Unit: unsupported-language files recorded as skipped; coverage surfaces include them.
- Unit: per-language fixtures produce expected symbols and edges (imports/calls/inherits/member-of).
- Integration: mixed-language repo produces chunks/symbols/edges for supported files; skipped files logged and tracked.
- Property: rerun on unchanged files skips reparse; changed files re-ingested with updated edges.
