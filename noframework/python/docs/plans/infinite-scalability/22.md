# Task 22 — Summaries Navigation-Only with Validation

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Build chunk → file → module → package summaries from source chunks only; propagate citations upward rather than inventing them.
- Keep summaries for navigation only: exclude them from drafting evidence while retaining them for retrieval ranking.
- Add sampling/validator loop to spot-check summaries against cited chunks and confidence, triggering re-summarization on failure.

## Deliverables
- Updated summarization pipeline that consumes chunk summaries, propagates citations, records real module/package identifiers, and enforces validation before insert.
- Guardrails that prevent summaries from being used as drafting evidence while keeping them queryable.
- Tests covering citation propagation, validator failures, and navigation-only enforcement.

## Test Plan
- Unit: chunk/file/module/package summaries include valid citations tied to stored chunks; invalid citations rejected.
- Unit: validator sampling catches malformed summaries and retries or marks failure.
- Integration: drafting uses only chunk evidence; removing summaries from evidence does not break retrieval/navigation.
