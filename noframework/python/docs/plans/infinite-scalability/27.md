# Task 27 — Evaluation & Regression Tests

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Enhance eval runner to re-run retrieval and claim checks against stored chunks/summaries/symbols, recomputing support/coverage/citation metrics.
- Emit metrics and rationales (including contradictions/missing citations) and allow persisted stores to be audited post-run.
- Add regression/property/golden tests for the iteration loop, citation enforcement/repair, retrieval reranking, and coverage gating behavior.

## Deliverables
- Eval runner updates with end-to-end recomputation of metrics from stored artifacts, plus CLI outputs and persisted audit data.
- Test suite additions: regression snapshots, property tests (idempotent ingest, gating stability), and golden runs over fixed repos/prompts.

## Test Plan
- Unit: eval runner recomputes metrics using stored artifacts; fails when citations/claims are stale or unsupported.
- Integration: golden/regression tests exercise iteration, enforcement, retrieval rerank, and coverage gating; property tests ensure ingest/idempotence and gate stability.
- CLI: eval runner emits metrics JSON and leaves persisted stores for audit when requested.
