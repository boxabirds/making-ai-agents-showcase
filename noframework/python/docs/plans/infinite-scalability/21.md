# Task 21 — Ingest & Graph Fidelity

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Ingest every file: parse with tree-sitter where supported; otherwise store raw chunks or explicit skip records so coverage sees the file.
- Emit qualified symbols (namespaced/parent-linked) and rich edges: calls/imports/implements/member-of/uses/exports with parent relationships.
- Support optional real embeddings (enable/disable deterministic hashes; plug real vectors when available); add symbol embeddings.
- Track skipped/unparsed files and keep them in coverage surfaces.

## Deliverables
- Updated ingestion pipeline producing symbols/edges/embeddings across languages with parent/context awareness.
- Skip/unsupported file recording with flags in the store.
- Tests/fixtures covering multi-language ingest, edge extraction, embeddings toggles, and skip tracking.

## Test Plan
- Unit: unsupported-language files recorded with skip flag; coverage surface includes them.
- Unit: per-language fixtures produce expected qualified symbols and edges (calls/imports/implements/member-of/uses/exports).
- Unit: embeddings toggle respected; symbol embeddings stored when provided.
- Integration: mixed-language repo ingested with skip records and cross-file import resolution preserved.
