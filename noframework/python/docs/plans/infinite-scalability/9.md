# Task 9 — Persisted-Store Tooling for Audits/Evals

Status: DONE

## Scope
- Build query tools/API to inspect a persisted store: files/chunks/symbols, summaries, claims, report versions.
- Export reports from DB; enable auditors to trace citations to chunks/lines.
- Provide CLI/subcommands usable when `--persist-store` was set.

## Deliverables
- Tooling layer (CLI) for queries: list files, reports, claims, symbols, summaries, symbol neighbors, search chunks, export report.
- Documentation of usage for evaluation workflows.

## Test Plan
- Integration: run pipeline with `--persist-store`; perform queries; outputs match stored artifacts.
- Property: queries bounded and deterministic ordering.
- Error handling: corrupted/missing DB surfaces clear errors; read-only safety enforced.
