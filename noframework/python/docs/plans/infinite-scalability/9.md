# Task 9 — Persisted-Store Tooling for Audits/Evals

## Scope
- Build query tools/API to inspect a persisted store: files/chunks/symbols, summaries, claims, report versions.
- Export reports from DB; enable auditors to trace citations to chunks/lines.
- Provide CLI/subcommands usable when `--persist-store` was set.

## Deliverables
- Tooling layer (CLI or functions) for queries: `list_files`, `search_chunks`, `get_symbol`, `symbol_neighbors`, `get_summary`, `get_report_versions`, `get_claims`, `export_report`.
- Documentation of usage for evaluation workflows.

## Test Plan
- Unit: each query validates inputs (Pydantic) and returns expected shapes; handles missing records gracefully.
- Integration: run pipeline with `--persist-store`; perform queries; outputs match stored artifacts.
- Property: queries bounded and deterministic ordering.
- Error handling: corrupted/missing DB surfaces clear errors; read-only safety enforced.
