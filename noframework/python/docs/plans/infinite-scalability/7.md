# Task 7 — Coverage Assessment, Issue Planning, Gating

Status: DONE

## Scope
- Derive expected surface per scope (symbols/endpoints/config/build targets) from stored data.
- Compute coverage vs report claims; identify omissions and severity.
- Build prioritized issue list (high/med/low) combining claim checks and coverage gaps.
- Gatekeeper logic to continue/stop iteration based on thresholds.

## Deliverables
- Coverage assessment (symbol-driven targets with file fallback) implemented in code.
- Issue planner merging claim failures and coverage gaps.
- Gate helper that decides whether to continue iterating.

## Test Plan
- Unit: expected-surface derivation (fixtures with known symbols/endpoints).
- Unit: coverage scoring given claims; omissions flagged with severity rules.
- Integration: issue list merges claim failures and coverage gaps; ordering by severity.
- Property: Gatekeeper decisions match thresholds (boundary conditions).
- Error handling: missing metadata triggers conservative coverage score and issue creation.
