# Task 16 — Claim Loop & Revision

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Grade claims with structured outputs tied directly to cited chunks; compute citation_score and support_rate explicitly.
- Add ReviseReport step that consumes planned issues to regenerate drafts and re-run checks until gates pass or max iterations hit.
- Persist iteration metrics and issue lists per version for auditing.

## Deliverables
- Structured claim grader outputs (status/severity/rationale) tied to specific citations.
- ReviseReport module wired into orchestrator loop with gating on support/coverage/citation metrics.
- Stored metrics/issue records per iteration; updated CLI options as needed.

## Test Plan
- Unit: claim grading returns structured statuses and rejects missing/invalid citations.
- Integration: iteration loop improves citation_score/support_rate across revisions until gates satisfied or limits reached.
- Regression: deterministic fixtures verify issue planning feeds revisions and metrics persisted per iteration.
