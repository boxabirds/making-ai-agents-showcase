# Task 25 — Claims, Verification, and Iteration Gating

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Define structured Pydantic schemas for claim extraction and claim checking outputs; include citations, status, severity, rationale.
- Keep claim citations aligned to the drafted report evidence; do not invent new citations during checking without updating the report.
- Persist issue lists and iteration status; re-run retrieve/check/revise until gates are met or fail with explicit rationale.

## Deliverables
- Claim extraction/check modules that validate outputs, tie citations to evidence, and surface contradictions/uncertainty with severities.
- Iteration loop that persists issues and iteration metrics, drives revision, and stops with clear pass/fail criteria.
- Tests covering claim schema validation, contradiction handling, and iteration gating over multiple attempts.

## Test Plan
- Unit: malformed claim extraction/check outputs rejected; citations must map to stored evidence.
- Unit: contradictory/uncertain claims set severity and block gate; issue lists persisted.
- Integration: gating loop performs retrieve→draft→check→revise cycles until thresholds are met or a failure report is emitted with rationale.
