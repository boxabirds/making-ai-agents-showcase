# Task 10 — BDD End-to-End & Regression Harness

Status: DONE

## Scope
- Define behavior-driven scenarios covering the full pipeline (ingest→summarize→retrieve→draft→verify→coverage→revise→output).
- Include regression harness comparing current reports/metrics to approved baselines.
- Scenarios must run with `--persist-store` to support auditing.

## Deliverables
- Pytest-based BDD/regression test with deterministic LLM stubs for end-to-end flow.
- Coverage of citation validity, gating thresholds, persistence behaviors (via existing CLI/audit tests).

## Test Plan
- BDD: scenarios for happy path (small repo) with deterministic stubs.
- BDD: citation validity checks, coverage thresholds, iteration stop conditions.
- Regression: compare generated report content to deterministic expectation.
- Performance/smoke: ensure runs complete under reasonable time for fixtures; artifacts cleaned up when not persisted.
