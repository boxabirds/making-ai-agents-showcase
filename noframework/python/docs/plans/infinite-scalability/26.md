# Task 26 — Coverage Surface & Metrics

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Derive expected surfaces from symbols plus endpoints/routes/config/build artifacts and unparsed/skipped files; support per-scope/module coverage.
- Count coverage only when citation-backed claims hit targets; remove string-contains heuristics.
- Feed coverage results into gating with clear missing-item reporting.

## Deliverables
- Coverage engine that builds structured expected surfaces, validates hits via citations, and supports module/package scoping.
- Updated gating to consume the new coverage metrics and missing-item detail.
- Tests for coverage construction, citation-backed hits, and gating behavior.

## Test Plan
- Unit: expected surfaces include endpoints/routes/config/build items and skipped files; string-contains matches rejected.
- Unit: coverage increments only when citations map to targets; missing items reported precisely.
- Integration: gating uses updated coverage to block/prompt revisions; per-module coverage available for inspection.
