# Task 11 — Eval Harness & Citation Verification

Status: DONE

## Scope
- Provide an evaluation harness that re-reads persisted stores, grades citation veracity, and emits metrics.
- Support persisted-store runs (`--persist-store`) to enable post-hoc evaluations.

## Deliverables
- `eval_runner` wiring to compute support, coverage, citation rates, and citation veracity.
- Metrics emitted as JSON or printed.

## Test Plan
- Integration: run pipeline on a small repo, then evaluate metrics from the persisted claims.
- Validation: citation veracity computation checks citations resolve to stored chunks.
