# Task 8 — Orchestrator & CLI (Persistence, Lifecycle)

## Scope
- Wire DSPy modules into an orchestrated loop: ingest → summarize → retrieve → draft → verify → coverage → revise (iterate).
- Implement CLI flags, including `--persist-store` (controls DB deletion), `--prompt`, `--model`, `--openai-api-key`, paths.
- Implement teardown: default delete working SQLite/logs; preserve when `--persist-store`.

## Deliverables
- Orchestrator driver invoking modules and managing iterations.
- CLI argument parsing and lifecycle management.
- Logging of artifacts and metrics per iteration.

## Test Plan
- Unit: CLI parsing (required flags, `--persist-store` behavior).
- Integration: end-to-end run on small fixture with stub LLM; verify lifecycle (DB deleted by default, retained with flag).
- Integration: iteration loop respects thresholds and max-iteration stop.
- Error handling: failed module surfaces clear error; teardown still executes appropriately.
