# Task 19 — Evaluation & Tests

Status: TODO

## Scope
- Extend eval_runner to re-run retrieval/claim checks against stored chunks to compute support/citation/coverage metrics.
- Add regression, property, and golden tests for iteration loop, citation enforcement, retrieval re-ranking, and gating behaviors.
- Ensure evals run against persisted stores for auditability.

## Deliverables
- Enhanced eval runner producing audited metrics via re-checks, not stored statuses alone.
- Test suites (regression/property/golden) covering iteration improvements, citation repair, retrieval ranking, and gate outcomes.
- Fixture repos and prompts for deterministic evaluations.

## Test Plan
- Unit: eval runner recomputes claim grades vs stored chunks; metrics reflect re-checks.
- Regression: golden tests for iteration loop behavior and citation enforcement on fixture repo.
- Property: retrieval re-ranking stability (lexical/graph precedence over embeddings); gating fails when coverage/support/citations below thresholds.
