# Task 6 — Claim Extraction & Verification

Status: DONE

## Scope
- Extract structured claims from drafts (subject/predicate/object/text + citations).
- Retrieve cited chunks/context and grade each claim: supported/contradicted/uncertain/missing; assign severity.
- Store claim results and rationales.

## Deliverables
- DSPy modules: `ExtractClaims`, `CheckClaims`.
- Pydantic models for claims and check results; persistence in `claims` table.

## Test Plan
- Unit: claim extraction validator; citations resolved to known chunks.
- Integration (stub LLM): claims extracted from sample drafts; verification labels match fixtures (supported/contradicted).
- Property: unsupported/missing-citation claims escalate severity appropriately.
- Error handling: missing citations triggers retrieval expansion; malformed outputs retried.
