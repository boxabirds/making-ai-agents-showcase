Prepare a markdown document that a language model can use that describes in 
exhaustive detail precisely how to 
1. Use the API this package provides to create an agent that can be run directly in python, e.g. "python agent.py". 
2. Answering the question "How can I use this API to create a Python ReAct agent
with tool calling?" 
3. It must include extensive grounding in the form of references to either source code (relative to project base) or URLs to docs online. 
4. Use specialist tools when provided: some tools provide scaffold tools that make light work of creating a new
agent, so they should definitely be chosen as part of the guide rather than
necessarily hand-coding everything. 
5. It should be created exclusively using extracts from the project: 100% veracity is critical.
