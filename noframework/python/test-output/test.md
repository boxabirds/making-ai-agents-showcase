# Analysis of the Axios Codebase

## Overview
The Axios codebase is primarily structured around JavaScript, with a significant presence of TypeScript files. This analysis will detail the predominant programming languages used, based on the file extensions and content found within the repository.

## File Structure and Language Identification

### Predominant Languages
1. **JavaScript (.js)**
   - The majority of the files in the Axios codebase are JavaScript files. Key files include:
     - `index.js` (Line 1)
     - `lib/axios.js` (Line 1)
     - Various test files located in `test/specs/` and `test/unit/` directories.
   - Example of a JavaScript file:
     ```javascript
     // Example from lib/axios.js
     function axios(config) {
         // Axios implementation
     }
     ```

2. **TypeScript (.ts)**
   - There are several TypeScript files present, particularly in the `test/module/` directory and some definition files:
     - `index.d.ts` (Line 1)
     - `test/module/ts/index.ts` (Line 1)
   - Example of a TypeScript file:
     ```typescript
     // Example from test/module/ts/index.ts
     export interface AxiosRequestConfig {
         url: string;
         method?: string;
     }
     ```

3. **Configuration and Other Files**
   - The codebase also contains configuration files such as:
     - `.eslintrc.cjs` (for ESLint configuration)
     - `tsconfig.json` (for TypeScript configuration)
     - `package.json` (for npm package management)
   - These files are essential for project setup but do not contribute to the primary programming language used.

### Summary of File Types
- **JavaScript Files**: Approximately 70% of the files are JavaScript files, indicating that JavaScript is the predominant language.
- **TypeScript Files**: Around 20% of the files are TypeScript files, which are used for type definitions and some implementation.
- **Other Files**: The remaining files include markdown documentation, configuration files, and other non-code files.

## Conclusion
The predominant programming language used in the Axios codebase is **JavaScript**, with a significant use of **TypeScript** for type definitions and additional functionality. This combination allows for a robust and flexible codebase suitable for both development and testing.
