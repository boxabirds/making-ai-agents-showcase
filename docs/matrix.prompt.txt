PROMPT TO REGENERATE TECH WRITER IMPLEMENTATION COMPARISON MATRIX

Task: Create a comprehensive comparison matrix analyzing all Python tech-writer.py implementations for an interactive side-by-side code comparison application.

Target output: docs/matrix.json

Requirements:

1. IMPLEMENTATIONS TO ANALYZE (Python only):
   - baremetal/python/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/adk-python/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/dspy/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/agno/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/langgraph/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/pydantic-ai/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/autogen/tech-writer.py
   - oss-agent-makers/atomic-agents/tech-writer.py

2. COMPARISON STRUCTURE:
   For each comparison pair, include:
   - vendor_a: string (implementation name without path)
   - vendor_b: string (implementation name without path)
   - summary: One paragraph comparing the approaches
   - suitability: Object with vendor_a and vendor_b keys explaining when to use each
   - overall_winner: String explaining which is better and why
   - pros_cons: Object with vendor_a and vendor_b keys, each containing pros and cons arrays
   - block_mappings: Array of semantic block comparisons

3. BLOCK MAPPING RULES:
   - Only include mappings where code in vendor_a corresponds to code in vendor_b
   - Each mapping must have:
     * description: What the code block does
     * vendor_a: {lines: [start, end], component: "description"}
     * vendor_b: {lines: [start, end], component: "description"}
     * comparison: Narrative comparing size, utility and friction (e.g., "vendor_a's implementation takes 87 lines whereas vendor_b's implementation is just 1 but that 1 line hides a lot of opaque capability")
   - Focus on meaningful semantic blocks like:
     * Agent/class definitions
     * Tool definitions/wrappers
     * Execution loops
     * Client initialization
     * Main analysis functions
     * Memory management (if exposed at all)
     * LLM integration

4. COMPARISON SELECTION:
   Create ALL possible pairwise comparisons (28 total for 8 implementations).
   Each implementation should be compared with every other implementation.
   
   Required comparisons (all 28 unique pairs):
   - baremetal vs: adk-python, dspy, agno, langgraph, pydantic-ai, autogen, atomic-agents
   - adk-python vs: dspy, agno, langgraph, pydantic-ai, autogen, atomic-agents
   - dspy vs: agno, langgraph, pydantic-ai, autogen, atomic-agents
   - agno vs: langgraph, pydantic-ai, autogen, atomic-agents
   - langgraph vs: pydantic-ai, autogen, atomic-agents
   - pydantic-ai vs: autogen, atomic-agents
   - autogen vs: atomic-agents
   
   These comparisons should showcase:
   - Manual implementation vs framework abstractions
   - Verbose vs minimal approaches
   - Sync vs async patterns
   - Different framework philosophies
   - Type-safe vs dynamic approaches

5. ANALYSIS APPROACH:
   For each implementation:
   - Count total lines
   - Identify major semantic blocks (imports, classes, tools, main logic)
   - Note exact line ranges for each component
   - Compare equivalent functionality across implementations
   - Highlight where one implementation needs many lines vs another needs few

6. JSON STRUCTURE:
   {
     "comparisons": [
       {
         "vendor_a": "implementation-name",
         "vendor_b": "implementation-name",
         "summary": "...",
         "suitability": {
           "vendor_a": "...",
           "vendor_b": "..."
         },
         "overall_winner": "...",
         "pros_cons": {
           "vendor_a": {
             "pros": ["..."],
             "cons": ["..."]
           },
           "vendor_b": {
             "pros": ["..."],
             "cons": ["..."]
           }
         },
         "block_mappings": [
           {
             "description": "...",
             "vendor_a": {"lines": [start, end], "component": "..."},
             "vendor_b": {"lines": [start, end], "component": "..."},
             "comparison": "..."
           }
         ]
       }
     ],
     "metadata": {
       "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
       "total_implementations": 8,
       "comparison_count": 28,
       "purpose": "Interactive side-by-side comparison of tech writer implementations"
     }
   }

Key insights to capture:
- Baremetal implements everything manually (315 lines)
- DSPy is the most minimal (119 lines)
- Frameworks abstract away boilerplate but add dependencies
- Tool integration varies from direct usage to complex wrappers
- Async vs sync patterns affect code structure
- Type safety (Atomic Agents, Pydantic-AI) vs simplicity trade-offs

The goal is to create data for an interactive UI where clicking a code block in one implementation highlights the corresponding block(s) in the comparison implementation, helping users understand different approaches to the same problem.
