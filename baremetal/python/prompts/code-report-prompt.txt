Create a comprehensive code analysis report named `code-report.md` that compares two implementations of a tech writer agent:
1. Baseline implementation at `@baremetal/python/tech-writer.py` 
2. Framework implementation at `@oss-agent-makers/[FRAMEWORK-NAME]/tech-writer.py`

Requirements:
- Count actual lines of code and calculate percentages
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams (not ASCII art)
- Include real code snippets for all comparisons
- Be objective and balanced in pros/cons analysis
- Focus on practical implications for developers
- Highlight key architectural differences
- Note any framework-specific concepts that need explanation


The report should analyze these key aspects in a logical order:

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview stating both implementations achieve the same goal
- High-level comparison table with columns: Aspect | Baseline | [Framework]
- Include rows for: Pros, Cons, Lines of Code, Execution Model

## LLM Support
- Which models are supported by each implementation
- How models are configured/initialized
- Any special handling required (e.g., wrappers, adapters)
- Show code snippets of model initialization

## Memory Management
- How conversation history is stored and managed
- Compare explicit vs implicit memory handling
- Code snippets showing memory operations
- Session/state persistence capabilities

## Tool Calling
- How tools are defined and registered
- Tool execution mechanisms
- Error handling in tool calls
- Compare manual vs automatic tool orchestration
- Include code snippets

## ReAct Support
- Explain how each implementation achieves the ReAct pattern
- Create Mermaid flowcharts showing:
  - Baseline: Explicit loop with visible state management
  - Framework: How the framework handles the loop internally
- Note if both use the same prompt
- Key differences in execution flow

## Performance
- Execution model (synchronous vs asynchronous)
- Overhead and efficiency considerations
- Streaming capabilities
- Concurrency support

## Shared Code
- What code is reused from baseline/common
- How utilities are imported and used
- Percentage of code that's framework-specific vs shared

## Maintenance
- Code complexity and readability
- Debugging considerations
- Framework lock-in implications
- Update and versioning concerns

## Architecture Diagrams (place where most appropriate)
Use Mermaid diagrams to visualize:
- Overall architecture of each implementation
- Data flow and component relationships
- ReAct execution loops



## Recommendations
- When to use baseline implementation (list specific scenarios)
- When to use framework implementation (list specific scenarios)
- Decision criteria for choosing between them
