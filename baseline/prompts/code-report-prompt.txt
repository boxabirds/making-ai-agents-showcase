Create a comprehensive code analysis report named `code-report.md` that compares two implementations of a tech writer agent:
1. Baseline implementation at `@baseline/tech-writer.py` 
2. Framework implementation at `@oss-agent-makers/[FRAMEWORK-NAME]/tech-writer.py`

The report should follow this structure:

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of both implementations
- State that both achieve the same goal but differ in architecture, complexity, and capabilities

## Comparison Overview
Create a table with the following columns:
- Aspect
- Baseline Implementation 
- [Framework] Implementation

Include rows for:
- Pros (use bullet points with <br> tags)
- Cons (use bullet points with <br> tags)
- Lines of Code (count actual lines)
- Dependencies
- Execution Model (sync/async)
- Memory Management
- Tool Calling
- Error Handling

## Architecture Analysis
For each implementation, create a Mermaid diagram showing the flow and components. Include:
- Main entry points
- Key classes/functions
- Data flow
- Use subgraphs where appropriate

Under each diagram, list Key Components with bullet points explaining the architecture.

## Code Complexity Analysis
For each implementation:
- Total line count
- Breakdown of complexity by component (e.g., "Agent class: ~X lines")
- List key methods/functions with their purpose
- Note any simplifications in the framework version

## ReAct Pattern Implementation
Create a dedicated section explaining how each implementation handles the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern:
- Note if both use the same prompt
- Create Mermaid flowcharts showing:
  - Baseline: Explicit loop management with visible state
  - Framework: How the framework handles the loop internally
- Explain the key differences in execution flow
- Include a "Key Insight" subsection

## Feature Comparison
Compare at least these features with code snippets:
1. Memory Management
2. Tool Calling  
3. Model Support
4. Error Handling

Show actual code snippets from each implementation to illustrate the differences.

## Performance Characteristics
Compare:
- Execution model (sync vs async)
- API call patterns
- Memory usage patterns
- Any framework-specific optimizations

## Maintenance Considerations
For each implementation, list:
- Pros for maintenance
- Cons for maintenance
- Consider: code visibility, flexibility, updates, testing

## Recommendations
Provide guidance on when to use each implementation:
- "Use Baseline Implementation when:" (list scenarios)
- "Use [Framework] Implementation when:" (list scenarios)

## Conclusion
Summarize:
- Percentage difference in code size
- Key tradeoffs
- Final guidance on choosing between implementations

Requirements:
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams (not ASCII art)
- Include specific line counts and percentages
- Show actual code snippets for comparisons
- Be objective about pros/cons of each approach
- Focus on practical implications for developers
