The provided text is a bash script to install a project. 
Review it to determine whether it is:
a) "Package option": the project can be used as an integrated package for the specified language ( such as bun add x or uv pip install x) or 
b) "Server required": requires to have a separate server or external SaaS to run. E.g. if docker is required, or a server being started these are pretty telltale signs of needing a separate server. 
Simply output ONLY the following: "Package option" or "Server required" and nothing else, no other text or delimiters are to be output.
