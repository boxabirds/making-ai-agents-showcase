The provided text is a bash script to install a project. 

Review it to determine:

= Part 1 =
Whether the format is:
"Package option": the project can be used as an integrated package for the specified language ( such as bun add x or uv pip install x) or 
"Server required": requires to have a separate server or external SaaS to run. E.g. if docker is required, or a server being started these are pretty telltale signs of needing a separate server. 

= Part 2 =
What language it is for (typically Python or TypeScript)

Output two values only, separated by commas: <Part 1>, <Part 2>, and no other values or delimiters.
