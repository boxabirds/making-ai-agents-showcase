Find the installation instructions in this project (often in the README) 
for using the project in its package form (not local builds)
The installation instructions might be for any programming language. Here are some tips for specific languages.

== Javascript / TypeScript ==
Prefer the bun instructions if there are any, but any package manager is ok. But pick only one
Make sure a supported version of node is available. 

== Python ==
For hybrid projects (multiple languages), choose python, ignoring all others. 

== Final output = 
Then create a bash script that installs it. 
The bash script is the only output -- no other narrative or escape sequences or backticks at start or end

== Extra Python instructions ==
We want to use the python package manager "uv" exclusively for python instructions. 
If the instructions don't include uv instructions
Comment the script contents out and create a version that uses uv. 
E.g. uv init / uv venv -p <required python version> / source .venv/bin/activate etc
It's important to remember when using uv that pip install becomes "uv pip install".
